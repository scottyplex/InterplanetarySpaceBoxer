# Weight on Planets Calculator

This is a fun and simple Python script that calculates your weight on other planets in our solar system. It takes your name and current weight as input and then uses the gravitational differences of other planets to determine what you would weigh on each one.

---

### Purpose

This script serves as a simple, interactive tool to demonstrate the concept of gravity's effect on weight. It's a great beginner's project for learning how to handle user input, use conditional logic (`if`/`elif`/`else` statements), and perform basic mathematical calculations in Python.

---

### Features

* **Interactive:** Prompts the user for their name, weight, and the planet they want to "visit."
* **Conditional Logic:** Uses `if`/`elif`/`else` statements to apply the correct gravitational multiplier for each planet.
* **Informative:** Provides a fun fact about each planet along with the weight calculation.
* **User-Friendly:** Accepts both the planet's name or its corresponding number as input.

---

### Usage

To use the script, simply run it from your terminal:

```
python weight_on_planets.py
```

The script will guide you through the process with simple prompts.

### Notes

* **Physics Fun:** The script uses approximate gravitational multipliers (relative to Earth's gravity). It's a fun way to explore physics concepts without complex formulas.
* **Adaptability:** This script can be easily modified to add more planets, include other astronomical data, or expand with more user interactions.
